Removing a Catalog Item
If we were to add the ability to remove a catalog item from a vendor, what would that look like as an HTTP request?

We only want Software Center Managers, or the Software Center team member that added it to be able to remove an item.
The name of each catalog item for a vendor must be unique.
Would this change our POST for catalog items?

What would you return if it is not unique?
